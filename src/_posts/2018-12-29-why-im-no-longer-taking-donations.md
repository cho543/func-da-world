[Haskell at Work](https://haskell-at-work.com/), the screencast
focused on Haskell in practice, is coming near its one-year
birthday. I've decided to stop taking donations through Patreon due to
the negative stress I've been experiencing.

Looking back at this journey. The first screencast was surprisingly
well received by followers on Twitter, and with the subsequent ones
being published rapidly, a follower base on YouTube grew quickly.
A thousand or so followers might not be exceptional for a programming
screencast channel on YouTube, but for me this was


* The Beginning
  - Started in January 2018
  - Huge support on Twitter
  - YouTube followers
  - Started with Patreon
  - Published many between January and May
* Fatigue kicks in
  - Vacation and summer leave
  - Got sidetracked on Komposition and gi-gtk-declarative
  - I'm not great at being consistent for a longer time, more bursts
    of creativity and energy
  - Lower pace, more anxiety, vicious circle
  - Thought about shutting down Patreon, but decided to pause it for a few months
* Some new energy
  - In November I had recovered some energy
  - Got great feedback at HaskellX in London
  - Published one screencast
  - Still felt a pressure that I had under-delivered
  - Donations had covered my recording equipment, hosting costs, and a few programming books
  - But the excess was feeding a feeling of guilt
* 2018 coming to an end
  - Taken a step back and thought about this carefully
  - Money is not a good driver for me
  - I want to do this because I love doing it
  - Videos will come when I have time and energy
  - Please keep giving me feedback on what would be nice to see, ideas are great
  - Also toying around with the idea to bring in guests and try new formats
  - Thank you all ...
